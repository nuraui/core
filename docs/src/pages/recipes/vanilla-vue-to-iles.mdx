New to Vue? 汳 Scaffold a new Vue project using the following command. Then, convert it into an ﾃｮles project.

```bash
npm create vue@latest # or pnpm, yarn, bun
```

The scaffolded Vanilla Vue project is powered by Vite and serves as a great example of basic Vue concepts, including the Single File Component structure, props, and slots. It's a Single-Page Application (SPA) with snappy navigation, powered by `vue-router`.

# Introduction

In this guide, we will convert this SPA into a static Multi-Page Application (MPA) site. Once completed, we will build and deploy static HTML pages with `zero` JavaScript. 

The goal is to understand the concepts by migrating between the two flavors (SPA and MPA).

<Iles/> builds static Multi-Page Application (MPA) sites. Checkout [Vitepress] and [Vite-SSG] to build static Single Page Application (SPA) sites.

## 1. Install ﾃｮles

Before installing, since ﾃｮles pre-includes `vite`, remove `"vite": "6.x.x"` from your `package.json` to prevent multiple Vite installations, which could cause TypeScript issues.

```bash
npm add -D iles@latest # or pnpm, yarn, bun
```

Once completed, start your development server with the following CLI command. Alternatively, refer to the [usage] to add commands to your `package.json`.

```bash
npx iles dev # or pnpm, yarn, bun
```

## 2. Remove `index.html` or Its Entry Files

The `index.html` entry page in your project root does not load any other assets apart from the entry file (`/src/main.ts`). Therefore, either remove it or delete the below script tag shown below.

```html
<script type="module" src="/src/main.ts"></script>
```

If you want to retain this `index.html` to add external assets from CDN, refer to the [static assets] page for details. Additionally, remove the `title` and `meta` tags in your custom `index.html` as ﾃ四es will add them automatically. 

## 3. Add `iles.config.ts`

Create an `iles.config.ts` file at your project root as shown below.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'iles'

export default defineConfig({
  siteUrl: 'https://myawesomeidea.com', // Your site URL
  modules: [
    // Add iles modules here, refer to Modules page
  ],
})
```

### Existing `vite.config.ts`

The `vite.config.ts` file in your project root, you can either keep it or migrate its configuration into the `vite` key of `iles.config.ts` as shown below.

<b>Important</b> Remove `@vitejs/plugin-vue` (Vite plugin for Vue)

- <b>Keeping</b> `vite.config.ts`: Remove `@vitejs/plugin-vue` from its plugins array to avoid conflicts, as ﾃｮles already includes it.

- <b>Migrating</b> to `iles.config.ts`: Do not include `@vitejs/plugin-vue` in the migration. After migrating, remove `vite.config.ts` file from your project root. You can also skip migrating `resolve.alias` object, as ﾃ四es already covers that.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'iles'
import vueDevTools from 'vite-plugin-vue-devtools'

export default defineConfig({
  siteUrl: 'https://myawesomeidea.com', // Your site URL
  modules: [
    // Add iles modules here, refer to Modules page
  ],
  vite: {
    // Vite configuration goes here
    plugins: [
      // Add vite plugins here
      vueDevTools(),
    ]
  }
})
```

## 4. Add `app.ts`

- Create an `src/app.ts` file as shown below. 
- Copy `import './assets/main.css'` from your entry file `src/main.ts` into `app.ts`.
- Remove or archive `main.ts` as it's not required anymore.

```ts
import '@/assets/main.css' // from `src/main.ts`
import { defineApp } from 'iles'

export default defineApp({
  head ({ frontmatter, site }) {
    return {
      meta: [
        { property: 'author', content: site.author },
        { property: 'keywords', content: () => frontmatter.tags },
      ],
      htmlAttrs: { lang: 'en-US' },
      bodyAttrs: {},
    }
  },
})
```

## 5. Add `site.ts`

Create an `src/site.ts` file as shown below:

```ts
export default {
  title: 'Cafe Tee Kaapi',
  description: 'Sip, Savor, and Spark Ideas!',
}
```

## 6. `App.vue` to Default Layout

- Create a new `src/layouts` folder, copy `App.vue` into it, and rename it to `default.vue`. 
- Convert the `RouterLink` components to simple anchor tags, change the `to` prop to `href`.
- Replace `<RouterView />` with `<slot/>`. This slot will load all your pages in your site. 

Your `layouts/default.vue` will look like the below.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import HelloWorld from '@/components/HelloWorld.vue'
</script>

<template>
  <header>
    <img alt="Vue logo" class="logo" src="@/assets/logo.svg" 
      width="125" height="125" />

    <div class="wrapper">
      <HelloWorld msg="You did it!" />

      <nav>
        <a href="/">Home</a>
        <a href="/about">About</a>
      </nav>
    </div>
  </header>

  <slot />
</template>

<style>
/* Existing styles */
</style>
```

> Remove the `src/router` folder, as ﾃｮles uses file-based routing. Any custom logic might need to be migrated to `app.ts`, your default layout, or one of your interactive Islands.

## 7. View to Pages

ﾃｮles uses the `pages` and `layouts` folder conventions with filenames in kebab-case.
- Rename the folder that contains all your pages (for example, `src/views`) to `src/pages`.
- Rename the `.vue` file of your home page (for example, `HomeView.vue`) to `index.vue`.
- Rename the `.vue` files of your other pages to follow kebab-case. For example, `AboutView.vue` could be renamed to `about.vue`
- Add a `<page></page>` tag at the top of your page files and add a `title` and `description` as `frontmatter`. 

Your `index.vue` page will look like the below.

```vue
<page>
  title: Home
  description: First Coffee, Then Conquer!
</page>

<script setup lang="ts">
import TheWelcome from '../components/TheWelcome.vue'
</script>

<template>
  <main>
    <TheWelcome />
  </main>
</template>
```

## 8. Add a New Page

ﾃｮles provides excellent support for authoring your pages with markdown (`.md`, `.mdx`). 

- Create a third page `src/pages/our-story.md` as shown below. 
- Add a third anchor tag for `our-story` under `nav` in `layouts/default.vue`. 

```md
---
title: Our Story
description: Crafting Memories, Brewing History!
---

# This is our story page
```

```vue
<!-- within layouts/default.vue  -->
<nav>
  <a href="/">Home</a>
  <a href="/about">About</a>
  <a href="/our-story">Our Story</a>
</nav>
```

## 9. Build Your Site

- Stop your development server by pressing `Cmd/Ctrl+C` in your terminal.
- Use the following command to build your site.
- Alternatively, refer to the [usage] to add commands to your `package.json`.

```bash
npx iles build # or pnpm, yarn, bun
```

Check the `dist` folder to see the three HTML pages generated along with their CSS assets. 

Note that `zero` JavaScript is shipped. To add interactive Islands, refer to the [frameworks] and [hydration] pages to learn about hydration client scripts.

## 10. Preview Your Site

- Use the following command to preview your site in your local browser.
- Alternatively, drag and drop the `dist` folder from your Finder or file-explorer into [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop) for instant deployment and preview.
- Test your production site by navigating through the different pages.

```bash
npx iles preview # or pnpm, yarn, bun
```

<Image src='@/assets/recipes/vanilla-vue-to-iles/netlify-drop.jpg' alt="Netlify Drop" wide narrow={false} />

If you used Netlify Drop, once deployment has completed successfully, click the `Open Production deploy` button to preview your site.

## What's Next

Now, learn about the [project structure] to familiarize yourself with the various conventions and best practices in ﾃｮles.

To add interactive ﾃｮslands to your static ﾃ四es site, explore using [frameworks], [client directives], and [client scripts].

Well Done. Have a joyful ﾃ四es experience!
