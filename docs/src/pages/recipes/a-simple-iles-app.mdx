In this guide, let's create a simple minimal Ã®les application.

/>

## 1. New Project Folder

From you terminal or integrated terminal in your code editor (Visual Studio Code),

Navigate to your desired location, create a new project folder and `cd` into it.

```bash
mkdir a-simple-iles-app
cd a-simple-iles-app
```

## 2. Create a Minimal Project

The following command will generate a minimal `package.json` file with default values.

```bash
npm init -y
```

Now is a good time to open your project folder in a code editor like Visual Studio Code. The minimal `package.json` shall look like this.

```json
{
  "name": "a-simple-iles-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "description": ""
}
```

## 3. Install Ã®les

Install `iles` using the following command.

```bash
npm add -D iles
```

This will create a `package-lock.json` which contains all the recursive set of dependencies. The dependencies are created within the `node_modules` folder.

## 4. Add Ã®les Executables

Add the `iles` executables in your `scripts` section of your `package.json`.

> Take a note that the `now` command will run both `build` and `preview` sequentially.

```json
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "iles dev",
    "build": "iles build",
    "preview": "iles preview --open",
    "now": "npm run build && npm run preview",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
```

## 5. Name and Description

Create a new folder `src` in your project root, and a file `site.ts` inside it.

Give your site a `name` and `description` like this:

```ts
export default {
  title: 'Cafe Tee Kaapi',
  description: 'Sip, Savor, and Spark Ideas!',
}
```

## 6. Add a layout

Our site shall have two pages that will share the same `header` and `footer`. So, it's a good idea to have a layout common for all these two pages.

Create a new folder `src/layouts`, and a file `default.vue` inside it. Here is a simple default layout with navigation in the `header` and an empty `footer`.

> Take a note of the `slot` tag into which various pages will be `slotted-in` with a common `header` and `footer`, above and below it.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
  import { computed } from 'vue'
  const { route } = usePage()

  const navs = [
    { title: 'Home', to: '/' },
    { title: 'About Us', to: '/about-us' },
  ]
  const currentPath = computed(() => {
    return route.path
  })
  // Other site-wide logic
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <header>
      <nav>
        <!-- NavBar vue island with client hydration strategy -->
        <a
          v-for="({ title, to }, index) in navs"
          :key="index"
          :href="to"
          :class="{ active: currentPath === to }"
        >
          {{ title }}
        </a>
      </nav>
      <!-- SearchBar solid island with client hydration strategy -->
    </header>
    <main>
      <!-- Pages are typically static with few dynamic islands -->
      <!-- Pages using this default layout will load in this slot -->
      <slot />
    </main>
    <footer>
      <!-- TheFooter static vue component with no interactions -->
    </footer>
  </div>
</template>

<style>
  body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    margin: 0;
    height: 200vh;
  }
  nav {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    gap: 1rem;
    padding: 1rem;
  }
  a {
    text-decoration: none;
    font-weight: bold;
  }
  a.active {
    text-decoration: underline;
  }
</style>
```

## 7. Create your Home Page

It's time to create our first page - the Home Page.

Create a new folder `src/pages`, and your home page as `index.vue` inside it. Here is a simple page authored as a Vue Single File Component.

The home page displays a card with your site's `name`, `description`, and `last updated date`, retrieved via the `usePage` composable (auto-imported by Ã®les), which provides `site`, `frontmatter`, and `meta` details.

> Take a note that the names of the layouts and pages must be in **lowercase**.

```vue
<page>
  title: Home
  description: First Coffee, Then Conquer!
</page>

<script setup lang="ts">
  const { site, frontmatter, meta } = usePage()

  const { title: siteTitle } = site
  const { description } = frontmatter
  const { lastUpdated } = meta
</script>

<template>
  <section class="hero">
    <div class="card">
      <h1>Welcome to {{ siteTitle }}</h1>
      <p>{{ description }}</p>
      <p>Site last updated: {{ lastUpdated.toDateString() }}</p>
    </div>
  </section>
</template>

<style scoped>
  .hero {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 60vh;
  }

  .card {
    text-align: center;
    padding: 2rem;
    background: #fff;
    border-radius: 8px;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
    border: 1px solid #ddd;
  }

  .card h1 {
    font-size: 2rem;
    margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
  }

  .card p {
    font-size: 1rem;
    color: #555;
  }
</style>
```

## 8. Start your Development Server

Let's experience Vite's developer experience with instant HMR while authoring our pages. Start your development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Once your development server is up and running, open its URL in your browser. 

In your home page `index.vue`, add the following tag below the paragraph (`<p>` tag) displaying the last-updated datetime. You'll notice that the browser updates instantly with HMR, without a page refresh.

```html
<small>- Built with Ã®les ðŸ’š</small>
```

## 9. Create the About Us Page

Ã®les provides excellent support for authoring your pages with markdown (`.md`, `.mdx`). Create a second page `src/pages/about-us.md` as shown below.

To see your second page, navigate to it by clicking on the `About Us` link in the navbar.

> Take a note that the names of the layouts and pages must be in **kebab-case**.

```md
---
title: About Us
description: Crafting Memories, Brewing History!
---

# This an about page

<style scoped>
main {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 60vh;
}
</style>
```

## 10. Build and Preview

Our minimal site is ready, let's build and preview it locally before deploying it.

The following command will build your page and open it in your browser. 

```bash
npm run now
```

Check the `dist` folder in your project root to find your two pages statically generated without any JavaScript, as no interactions have been added to the site yet.

<Image
  src="@/assets/recipes/a-simple-iles-app/iles-build.jpg"
  alt="A Simple Ã®les App"
  wide
  narrow={false}
/>

## What's Next

Author more pages in `md`, `mdx` or `vue` formats. Don't forget to add the slug of the new pages you create to the `nav` array in your default layout (step-6 above).

Learn about the [project structure] to familiarize yourself with the various conventions and best practices in Ã®les.

To add interactive Ã®slands to your static ÃŽles site, explore using [islands] and [frameworks].

Well Done. Have a joyful ÃŽles experience!
