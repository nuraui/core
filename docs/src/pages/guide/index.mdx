## Installation 💿

Run the following command to create a new îles project using the [starter] template. Then, follow the [usage](#usage) section.

```bash
pnpm create iles@next # or npm or yarn
```

## Add îles to an Existing Project 💙 

Add îles to your existing Vite-powered project using the following command:

```bash
npm add -D iles@latest # or pnpm, yarn, bun
```

îles serves pages from the `src/pages` folder, so ensure your pages are located there. They must be in one of the supported formats: `.vue`, `.md`, or `.mdx`. For example,

<div class="language-tree">
<pre class="code">
<code>
<kbd class="-ml-2">src/</kbd>
  ├── <kbd>pages/</kbd>
  │    ├── index.vue
  │    └── about.md 
  │    └── posts/
  │         ├── intro.mdx
  │         └── our-story.mdx
  
</code>
</pre>
</div>

Now, follow the next [usage](#usage) section. Also explore the [recipes] page to learn through examples.

## Usage 🚀

Add the iles executable to the `scripts` section of your `package.json` if it's not already there.

```json
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "iles dev",
    "build": "iles build",
    "preview": "iles preview --open",
    "now": "npm run build && npm run preview"
  },
```

From your terminal or integrated terminal of your editor (Visual Studio Code),

### Install your dependencies:

```bash
npm install # or pnpm, yarn, bun
```

### Start your development server:

```bash
npm run dev # or pnpm, yarn, bun
```

### Build for production:

Generates the final output (by default, `dist` folder).

```bash
npm run build # or pnpm, yarn, bun
```

### Preview your site locally after building:

```bash
npm run preview # or pnpm, yarn, bun
```

### Alternatively, Build and Preview with a single command:
